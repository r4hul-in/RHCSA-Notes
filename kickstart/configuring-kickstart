Kickstart
---------

## Install kickstart

 # yum install system-config-kickstart
 
## Configure kickstart from GUI tool and save it to home directory

 # system-config-kickstart
 
## Setup kickstart server - Assuming httpd server is already installed and firewall is configured

 # cd /var/www/html
 
 # mkdir kickstart
 
 # cd kickstart/
 
 # cp ~/anaconda-ks.cfg *
 
## Edit ks file according to your needs - File attached

 # vim anaconda-ks.cfg

## Validate kickstart file syntax

 # ksvalidator anaconda-ks.cfg
 
## Restore Selinux context

 # restorecon -RvF /var/www/html
 
## Installing a RHEL instance with a kickstart file by virt-manager

 # While booting from RHEL installation media press TAB at boot menu and add following option to boot option
 
 # ks=http://192.168.100.1/kickstart/anaconda-ks.cfg
 
 * Add ip=dhcp and/or ksdevice=<ifname> if necessary
 
 * Remove quiet flag also in order to debug any problem if you might face
 
 * Command to generate encrypted passwd
   
   # python -c 'import crypt,getpass;pw=getpass.getpass();print(crypt.crypt(pw) if (pw==getpass.getpass("Confirm: ")) else exit())'
   
 * We can also use ftp - vsftpd and nfs and just putting ks file in installation media itself.
  
 * Generating encrypted passwd for standard user isn't need as of now. We call simply skip --iscrypted option and just add plaintext passwd in password=yournakedpasswd
